# ProjectDNC
The purpose of this project is to provide basic classes and functionality to make code more readable.

Motivation:
C++ is not the programming language I learned from the start. So coming from C# and Java I had problems reading C++ Code.
I'm aware, that the .NET Framework is available for C++, but the code then is not native and cross-plattform anymore.
A short web search didn't show any noticable open-source solutions, that could offer the functionality of .NET.
So I started this little side-project to bring the comfort of .NET to native C++.

As mentioned above, I am not an experienced C++ developer, so the code is not optimized or anything.
But I'm open to constructive criticism.
