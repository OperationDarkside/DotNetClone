Rules to contribute to this project are a follows in about this order of importance:

1. Your code has to compile/run
2. Modern C++ (no "new" or "delete" etc)
2. To the outside (the user), it has to look like .NET Syntax
3. Comments would be REALLY NICE to have
4. Tests - Even better
5. Documentation - GODLIKE
6. Constructive interaction with other contributors - M-m-m-m-monsterkill (kill-kill-kill)
